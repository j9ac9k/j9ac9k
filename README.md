### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ogi Moore, a Software Developer with a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science background. I currently maintain [pyqtgraph](https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph), and have broader interests in the PyData ecosystem; and cheer from the sidelines development of tools like [moonlight](https://github.com/moonlight-stream), [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg), [VisPy](https://github.com/vispy/vispy), [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) and [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) to name a few.  My academic interests are in control theory, optimization, and ~~statistics~~ data science.

I primarily write software in Python, but have dabbled in Swift, Haskell, C, Tcl, and even Prolog.

âš¡ Fun fact: The name of the whale in the Docker logo is Molly.
